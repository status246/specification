## What is Status 246?

Status 246 "Guardrail Check Failed" indicates that a request was processed successfully, but automated safety checks (guardrails) detected issues worth knowing about.

```http
HTTP/1.1 246 Guardrail Check Failed
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": {
    "response": "I can help you with that task.",
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "usage": { "tokens": 150 }
  },
  "guardrail_results": {
    "verdict": "failed",
    "checks": [
      {
        "id": "content_policy",
        "status": "failed",
        "confidence": 0.85,
        "message": "Potential policy violation detected"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## The Problem

AI systems with safety guardrails face a communication challenge:
- **200 OK** hides safety violations from monitoring systems
- **4xx/5xx errors** inappropriately block requests that should continue
- No standard way to indicate "succeeded with warnings"

## Why Status 246?

- **üîç Transparency**: Safety violations are explicitly communicated
- **üìä Compliance**: Track and audit policy violations without blocking requests  
- **üëÅ Observability**: Clear separation between system errors and content policy issues
- **‚ö° Flexibility**: Applications can decide how to handle flagged content based on severity

## Adopters

Organizations using Status 246 in production:

- **[Portkey AI](https://portkey.ai)** - AI Gateway and Guardrails Platform
- **[Add your organization](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Submit a PR to be listed

## Use Cases

- **AI Chat Applications**: Flag potentially harmful responses while still delivering them
- **Content Generation**: Warn about policy violations in generated text/images
- **Document Processing**: Indicate PII detection without blocking document access
- **API Gateways**: Communicate guardrail violations in AI service routing

## Status Code Behavior

| Status | Guardrail Result | Request Processing | Use Case |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 200 | Passed | Completed | All checks passed, content is safe |
| 246 | Failed | Completed | Issues detected, but request processed |
| 446 | Failed | Blocked | Critical violations, request denied |
